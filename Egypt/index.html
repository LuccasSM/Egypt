					<h1>Over the Egypt</h1>
					<p>Egypt, a country that links northeast Africa to the Middle East, dates back to the time of the pharaohs. Monuments built millennia ago are located along the fertile 
					Nile River valley, such as the colossal Pyramids of Giza and the Sphinx, as well as the Temple of Karnak (full of hieroglyphics) and the tombs of the Valley of the Kings, 
					both in Luxor. The capital, Cairo, is home to Ottoman monuments like the Mosque of Muhammad Ali and the Egyptian Museum, with a collection of antiques. Egyptian pyramids 
					are ancient masonry structures built by the civilization of Ancient Egypt. As of November 2008, there were sources citing between 118 and 138 identified Egyptian pyramids. 
					Most of them were built as tombs for the pharaohs and their consorts during the periods of the Ancient and Middle Kingdom.</p>

						<h2>Tourism Areas</h2>
						<p>Of course, when we talk about Egypt, we talk about its pyramids, to enlighten you as a tourist, about this charming ancient work. Anyway, they are the best known in Egypt. Although there are hundreds of them, they stand out due to their size and the fact that they are the only one among the 7 Wonders of the Ancient World that still stand.

							Located in the capital Cairo, the pyramids are dated to 2700 BC and are the landmark of the architecture of a super advanced civilization for the time.
							
							The ticket to visit the outside of the complex, which involves the pyramids and the Sphinx, costs 120 Egyptian pounds. But to enter the pyramid, you have to pay an additional 300 Egyptian pounds.</p>

					<h2>The pyramids of Egypt</h2>
					<p>The pyramids were built at a time when a rich and powerful civilization was flourishing in Egypt. Its construction began in the Old Empire (around 2686 to 2181 BC) and lasted until the 4th century AD, but the peak of construction is registered between the Third and Sixth Dynasty, around the year 2325 BC In that period, Egypt lived under political stability and economic prosperity. In turn, the pharaohs believed to be a kind of deity chosen to be the mediators between gods and humans. Therefore, after physical death, the Egyptians believed that the spirit of the king, who was known as Ka, remained in the body and needed special care. Thus, their corpses were mummified. In the process of mummification, Pharaoh's body was carefully treated with oils and wrapped in bands so that he would not suffer from the wear and tear of time. Some organs, such as the intestine and liver, were removed, but placed in special urns next to the sarcophagus. In addition, Pharaoh was buried with everything he would need after death, such as his treasures, food and even furniture. Family members, priests and officials were also buried with Pharaoh.</p>

							<h3>Security Notes</h3>
							<p>
								Security is a topic that always comes to mind when planning to travel to Egypt. It is possible to visit the country with peace of mind if you follow some important guidelines. According to the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, trips to Egypt must be “highly cautious”. Busier hotels and tourist places usually have strict security procedures. However, it is worth taking additional precautions, as with the use of valuables, for example.</p>
